# Artificial-Intelligence
This project involves training the Pacman agent on various search Algorithms to find paths through the maze world.
The project also covers building an intelligent agent using Markov Decision Process, dynamic path planning algorithms, Reinforcement learning, value iteration and q-learning to enable the agent to plan it's path dynamically to reach the goal.
